# Snake Game
It's a snake game.
You know how this works.

This little game was written in C with the [Allegro](https://github.com/liballeg/allegro_wiki/wiki/Allegro-Vivace) library
because I wanted to start learning C.


## Known Issues
 - Memory leak when moving snake
 - Apple might spawn inside wall
 - Fast direction changes can lead to snake turning on one pixel and dying instantly
 - Code could be much cleaner
 - Add option to change speed
